-Fetching Data Using Http calls and Mock Api\
-AppBar, ListViewBuilder, ListTile, FutureBuilder, Floating Action Button Extended, Card, Circle Avatar

In the above app, I’m fetching data from “Mock API” which is coming in JSON and showing that data on the screen using Future Builder which returns List View Builder and it contains the List Tile Widget which wrapped inside a Card Widget. There’s one FABE (Floating Action Button Extended), using which app shows the data on the screen. Other than this there are some small features like Circular Progress Indicator, etc.
